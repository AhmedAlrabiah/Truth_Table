# Truth_Table
  <p>Inspired by the sixth chapter of Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.<br>
  This script of code takes certain premises and a conclusion then returns a truth table<br>
  It only works with certain types of propositional premises which are as listed:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>p</li>
  <li>~p</li>
  <li>p&q</li>
  <li>p or q</li>
  <li>if p then q</li>
  <li>and their combinations with parenthesis.</li>
  </ul>
  It accepts any variable in the English alphabet, capital or small.</p>
